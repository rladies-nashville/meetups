Thanks to all who attended for the great discussion! Following is a summary of notes and ideas from
our kickoff meeting.

# Motivation/Goals for R-Ladies Nashville Participation
- Learn R basics
- Have a group to bounce ideas off of when coding/planning
- Safe space to ask questions about R and related concepts (Github, eg)
- Learning how to "translate" plain language to R and vice versa
- Opportunities for giving presentations (-> deeper learning!)
- Opportunities for mentoring/being mentored
- Social/networking
- See how others approach similar problems

# Meetup Ideas
- Start a Google Doc with topic ideas so people can be thinking about what they're able to present: **done**! [Add your topics or sign up here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PSSgVv7ACrDotzbj7DcMqJHhruBGmrxlNvKQBU6LDjE/edit?usp=sharing), and great idea Alli!
- General enthusiasm for switching back and forth between evening and lunchtime meetups (longer ones in PM, hour or less at lunch)
- [Software Carpentry-style](http://swcarpentry.github.io/r-novice-inflammation/) tutorial session for R basics - may not be of interest to everyone but would be highly beneficial for some
- Mentoring sessions - dedicated time for paired learning/teaching
- Pair R-Ladies with related user group meetings: for example, meet for dinner before Nashville RUG, or have a debrief after RUG (note: we've been in touch with both Nashville RUG and Data Science Nashville and both have been very open to co-hosting events)
- Potential locations:
    - Meharry and Lipscomb campuses (LU has easy parking at night!)
    - Emma Bistro - need to get on this way in advance
    - Iron Yard
    - Nashville Software School
- People who have volunteered for organizational help: Mary, Liz, Jenn M, Dilman, Sarah, Hannah (thank you!!)
- Meetups to be aware of/avoid conflicts with/co-participate in (usual meeting times, if applicable):
    - [Nashville R Users Group](https://www.meetup.com/Nashville-R-Users-Group/)
    - [PyNash](http://www.meetup.com/PyNash/) (4th Thursdays, lunch on first Fridays)
    - [Greater Nashville Healthcare Analytics](https://www.meetup.com/Greater-Nashville-Healthcare-Analytics/) (second Tuesdays)
    - [Data Science Nashville](http://www.meetup.com/Data-Science-Nashville/) (first Wednesdays, often)
    - [Machine Learning](http://www.meetup.com/Nashville-Machine-Learning-Meetup/)
    
# Future Planning
- Next meetup would be lunch in December
- Supplement with something like a half-day tutorial for R basics
- Maybe send out a second survey, since many people didn't join till after the first one closed; also ask about:
    - sponsors
    - barriers to participation
- Use Slack for community communication: Our team is [rladies-nashville.slack.com](http://rladies-nashville.slack.com); get in touch with Lucy or Jennifer to join ([intro to Slack](https://slack.com/is))
- Create list of resources (Hopkins Coursera course, etc)
- Add your topic ideas/requests or sign up for topics [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PSSgVv7ACrDotzbj7DcMqJHhruBGmrxlNvKQBU6LDjE/edit?usp=sharing)!
